        <p>Hi! My name is Alda Ann Lee and Iâ€™m a photographer & designer 
        from Atlanta, Ga.  I love art, traveling, cooking, savory food, and dogs. 
        I love cats too. I actually have a dog and a cat too. I like to try new things and go on adventures. 
        <br><br>
        I have a Bachelor of Arts in Communications with a concentration in 
        film and a minor in journalism from Georgia State University. 
        I am currently in a UX/UI program to gain more skills in design and research. 
        I have always been interested in visual & web design so this program is 
        the right fit for me. </p>
